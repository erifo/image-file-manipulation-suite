# Image-file Manipulation Suite
A collection of short scripts I reuse from time to time.
 
## Resize: Shrinks originals to save space.
Halves the size of any .jpg sharing directory with the script. Saves the new files in ./resized. Uses Pillow.

## Filter: A quick way to filter out the pictures you wish to keep.
Displays each .jpg sharing directory with the script, in addition to each .jpg in subdirectories. Left and right arrow-keys navigates between images. Spacebar copies it to ./filtered. Uses Pygame.
